&lt;a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com"&gt;https://morepypy.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;. From now on,
the posts will be here, at &lt;a href="https://pypy.org/blog"&gt;https://pypy.org/blog&lt;/a&gt;. The
RSS feed is &lt;a href="https://pypy.org/rss.xml"&gt;https://pypy.org/rss.xml&lt;/a&gt;. The original
content has been migrated to the newer site, including comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the motivations for the move were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;One site to rule them all&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding the blog posts here seems like a natural extension of the web site
rather than outsourcing it to a third-party. Since the site is generated using
the static site generator &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;nikola&lt;/a&gt; from the github repo
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org"&gt;https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org&lt;/a&gt;, we also
have good source control for the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CI previews, and github&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who follow PyPy may note something new in the URL for the repo:
until now PyPy has been using &lt;a href="https://mercurial-scm.org"&gt;mercurial&lt;/a&gt; as hosted
on &lt;a href="https://foss.heptapod.net"&gt;https://foss.heptapod.net&lt;/a&gt;.  While
&lt;a href="https://heptapod.net/"&gt;heptapod&lt;/a&gt; (a community driven effort to bring mercurial
support to GitLab™) does provide a GitLab CI runner for the open source
offering, on github it is easier to integrate &lt;a href="https://netlify.com"&gt;netlify&lt;/a&gt;
for previews. Hopefully the move to the more popular github platform will
encourage new contributors to publish their success stories around using PyPy
and the RPython toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Comments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments to blog posts are generated via the &lt;a href="https://utteranc.es/"&gt;utterances&lt;/a&gt;
javascript plugin. The comments appear as issues in the repo.
When viewing the site, a query is made to fetch the comments to the issue with
that name. To comment, users must authorize the utterances app to post on their
behalf using the &lt;a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow"&gt;GitHub
OAuth&lt;/a&gt; flow.
Alternatively, users can comment on the GitHub issue directly. The interaction
with github for authentication and moderation seems more natural than the
manual moderation required on blogspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Please prove to us that the move is worth it&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help us with guest blog posts, and PRs to improve the styling of the site. One
already &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org/issues/5"&gt;open issue&lt;/a&gt; is that the
navbar needlessly uses javascript, help to keep the responsive style in pure
CSS is welcome. The theme could also use tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, we want to hear from you.  Guest blog posts about
PyPy are welcome. Just follow the directions in the repo's README to create a
PR with your favorite PyPy story.&lt;/p&gt;
